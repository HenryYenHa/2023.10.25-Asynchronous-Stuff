2. Can I make a class and use a class inside an async function?

HTTP STUFF:

- Clients send a request with IP Address and Method (Post Get Put or Delete)
- Server responds with Status code and Payload

Async Stuff:

- Promises: when calling for data over the net in JS, the script won't wait for the data to
  PROMISE: uses <pending>
  <pending> will only be a success or failure

Note: Use Postman web browser to check APIs
